## Hey friend! Nice to meet you :)

I am a 17yo freshman studying in one of the best institutions of the country. Life has been really hectic since then, but we all have to power through it anyway, don't we. I haven't been getting much free time because of the intensive course in the college, but I'm trying to learn new things every time.

I have a __~7 year experience__ in programming â€” my dad introduced me to Khan Academy when I was 10. I started out in the processing.js environment there, and gradually shifted to web development because I found that more appealing and useful. On top of that, I'm a __basketball and badminton player and I also play the electronic keyboard__.
My skills in coding include:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- C/C++
- Node.js
- React
- Express.js
- MySQL

I have been trying to get better at all these, but the life of a stressed-out adult can only afford this much free time. I am confident that I'll continue to learn more skills and expand on my range.

Until then, happy coding :)
